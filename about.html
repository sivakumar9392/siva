            <p>Hello! I'm Sivakumar, a passionate and driven computer science student with a deep love for technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. From a young age, I've been captivated by the ever-evolving world of computing and its endless possibilities.
            Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at vellore institute of technology(vellore), I've delved into a wide array of subjects ranging from algorithms and data structures to artificial intelligence and machine learning
            Beyond the classroom, I actively engage in extracurricular activities that complement my academic pursuits and contribute to my personal and professional development. Whether it's participating in Clubs/Organizations, volunteering for Causes/Organizations, or taking on leadership roles, I strive to broaden my horizons and cultivate a well-rounded skill set.</p>
